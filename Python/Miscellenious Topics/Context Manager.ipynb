    "it's a way to ensure that certain code runs before a block of code executes, and other cleanup code runs after, no matter what happens even if an exception is raised.\"\n",
    "The primary need is for robust resource management and ensuring deterministic cleanup.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Problem (Without a Context Manager):\n",
    "- Verbose: You have to write the same boilerplate code every time.\n",
    "- Error-prone: It's easy to forget the finally block.\n",
    "- Less Readable: The core logic is nested inside the error-handling code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Solution (With a Custom Context Manager):\n",
    "- Cleanup Guarantee: The teardown code (closing, releasing) always runs.\n",
    "- Exception Safety: Your resources won't leak if your code encounters an error.\n",
    "- DRY Principle: You write the setup/teardown logic once and reuse it.\n",
    "- Clarity & Readability: The with block clearly defines the scope of the resource."
